    \section*{Acknowledgements}
    This thesis was written in an extraordinary year, during which I received a great deal of support.\\

    I would first like to thank my supervisor, dr. John Ashley Burgoyne, for sharing his expertise and aptitude for performing multidisciplinary research in music. Your invaluable insights and feedback brought this work to a higher level - not to mention your firm commitment and support during the last few days before the ISMIR paper deadline. I would also like to thank him for introducing me to many of the fantastic people in MIR research during ISMIR 2019 in Delft, which was both a stepping-stone for this research and my research career. Your teaching, guidance and support are experiences I will cherish.\\

    I would also like to thank my mentor, dr. Jordan B.L. Smith for his support and guidance throughout 2020, and his help to shape the accompanying research paper's final review version for ISMIR.\\

    I would also like to acknowledge all my colleagues from the MSc Artificial Intelligence of the University of Amsterdam. I would like to thank them for the many great discussions, fun activities and study sessions: without them, this incredible subject would have been so much harder to understand.\\

    In addition, I would like to thank my parents for their love and support. Thank you for always being there for me.\\
    
    Finally, I could not have completed this work without my friends, who provided love, valuable discussions and joyful distractions during this extraordinary year.\\
